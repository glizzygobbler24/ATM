    "Inside an automated teller machine (ATM) there are notes of $10, $5, and $1. Write a Python program to emulate the way this ATM works. \n",
    "At the beginning, the machine prompts the user to enter the four-digit PIN and then checks for PIN validity (assume “1234” as the valid PIN). If given PIN is correct, the program must prompt the user to enter the amount of money (an integer value) that he or she wants to withdraw and finally it displays the least number of notes the ATM must dispense. \n",

    "For example, if the user enters an amount of $36, the program must display “3 note(s) of $10, 1 note(s) of $5, and 1 note(s) of $1”. Moreover, if the user enters a wrong PIN, the machine will allow him or her two retries. If the user enters an incorrect PIN all three times, the message “PIN locked” must be displayed and the program must end. Assume that the user enters a valid value for the amount.\n"
